Consumer Price Index (CPI) Conversion Factors for Dollars of 1774 to estimated 2027 to Convert to Dollars of 2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CAUTION:  Estimates for 2017-2027 are based on the average of OMB and CBO estimates as of early 2017.  They will be revised in 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To convert dollars of any year to dollars of the year 2016,  DIVIDE the dollar amount from that year by the conversion factor (CF) for that year.  For example, $1000 of 1945 = $13,333 dollars of 2016 ($1000 / 0.075).  Rounding is strongly recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Notes:  Conversion factors are based on final 2016 annual average CPI:  2.40007, re-based so that 2016 = 1.000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To reverse the process, that is, to determine what a 2016-dollar amount would be in dollars of another year, simply  MULTIPLY the year 2016 amount by the conversion factor for that year.  For example, $1000 of 2016 would be about $75 in dollars of 1945 ($1000 x 0.075 = $75).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data series since 1912 have changed periodically, so numbers are not all precisely comparable.  Therefore it is recommended that numbers be ROUNDED to four  (or, more cautious, three) significant digits. So, $13,333 in the example above becomes $13,330 or $13,300.  For years prior to 1913, rounding to three (or more cautious, two) significant digits is recommended, e.g. $13,333 becomes $13,300 or even $13,000.  ALMOST ALWAYS, ROUNDING TO DOLLARS AND CENTS SUGGESTS MORE PRECISION THAN THE DATA ALLOW.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
