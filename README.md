## Project Description

This project revolves around using the MCU database, as well as supporting information from the IMDb database and Wikidata, for determining the impact of actors on the success of a movie. This will be done through the creation of an impact score metric that links the movie revenues, ratings, and actor experience. This would essentially allow for the understanding of how the impact of actors evolves over time as they gain experience, or how impacts vary across different genders or movie genres. From there a predictive model could even be built to understand the weights behind the different factors constituting this metric. For that purpose, actor information as well as their movie revenues will be taken from the MCU database, whereas movie ratings will be obtained from the IMDb database, and movie budgets from Wikidata.
